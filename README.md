#AttendanceTracker:

  # Utilizes an ID scanner to determine members of my fraternity that are absent. If an IDE is available in Java, all one
  # would need to run is the ID scanner as well as access to a spreadsheet. It automatically prints the names of the members
  # associated with the ID number that printed.
