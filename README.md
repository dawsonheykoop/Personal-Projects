## Random Member Generator:

  ### Takes a csv file of members from the chapter of my fraternity at UArizona 
  ### Generates a random number and reads the member at that row in the data
  ### Purpose: Used for things such as a lottery where everyone pitches a dollar and the random member wins the total.


## AttendanceTracker:

  ### Utilizes an ID scanner to determine members of my fraternity that are absent. If an IDE is available in Java, all one
  ### would need to run is the ID scanner as well as access to a spreadsheet. It automatically prints the names of the members
  ### associated with the ID number that printed.
